This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML/JavaScript.  The bug involves attempting to set the `innerHTML` property of an element that does not exist in the DOM. This results in a silent failure â€“ no error is thrown, but the intended change to the page does not occur. The solution shows how to properly check for the element's existence before attempting to modify its content.
